# Notes on Hilbert spaces

This is an in-progress set of course notes on Hilbert and Banach spaces. It assumes some level of familiarity with the basics of topology (open sets, metric spaces) and real analysis (which provides nice examples). Exposure to the basic ideas of complex analysis is also useful. The text was originally in parallel with Young's _Introduction to Hilbert Spaces_, though recently I've pulled in various proofs and ideas from other sources, including Kreszig's classic book and various internet discussions. 

## Current state:

I just finished a term teaching out of Young, and I've added new material on the convergence of Fourier series, convolution, dual spaces, the Riesz representation theorem, linear operators, and compact operators. I ended the course with the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators on a separable Hilbert space. I also took an application from Agler, McCarthy, and Young's text on operator analysis to show the idea of reproducing kernels and connections between operator methods and function theory.

## To do:
Lots of sections of the newest material are incomplete. Exercises need to be added to chapters 6-10. I gave an examination that asked students to derive the singular value decomposition from the spectral theorem, and I'd like to add that to the chapter on compact operators (which is missing most of the development at the moment). The long-term goal is to build a second part of the text on the full spectral theorem for normal operators and the GNS construction.
