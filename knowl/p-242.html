<p>We are now ready to establish a generalization of coordinates and basis appropriate to Hilbert space. That is, we would like to make sense of finding a coordinate expression for a vector \(x\) in a Hilbert space \(\hilbert\text{.}\) The primary geometric difficulty that we have to wrestle with is that we have infinite “directions” in which extra stuff can hide. We need to know that the orthonormal sequence we're expanding against doesn't leave any directions hidden.</p>
