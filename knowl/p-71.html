<p>To develop intuition and to show how inner product gemetry interacts with other mathematical structures, particularly those of analysis, we need more examples. The first three spaces in some sense very much resemble Euclidean space. They are easy to work with but don't reveal the more nuanced structure of Hilbert spaces. On the other hand, general continuous functions are about as hard to grasp a collection of objects as exists in mathematics (<a class="external" href="http://nautil.us/issue/11/light/maths-beautiful-monsters" target="_blank">“I turn away with fear and horrow from the lamentable plague of continuous functions which do not have derivatives...” Hermite to Stieltjes, 1893</a> - unfortunately, <a class="external" href="http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~marker/math414/fs.pdf" target="_blank">most continuous functions are pathological in this sense</a>).</p>
