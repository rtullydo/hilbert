<p>We saw in the previous section that \(C[0,1]\) is an inner product space that is not complete. This is unfortunate, as the continuous functions are the foundation of approximation and analysis. The inner product <a data-knowl="./knowl/eq-C-ip.html" title="Equation 2.1.1">(2.1.1)</a> is a natural analogue of the inner product in \(\C^n\text{,}\) considering the extension of sums to integral. It seems a shame to forgo working with the inner product and the space of continuous functions. But if we want to use them, we'll need to come up with a Hilbert space that contains \(C[0,1]\text{,}\) which is necessarily going to involve discontinuous functions (see the example at the beginning of the previous section, or the exerise in the problem section below).</p>
