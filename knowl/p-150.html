<p>With the inner product given by <a data-knowl="./knowl/eq-ell2-ip.html" title="Equation 2.1.2">(2.1.2)</a>, the space \(\ell^2\) of sequences of square summable functions acts much like \(\C^n\text{.}\) We can extend this analogy further. In Euclidean space, a sequence that looks convergent is convergent. (This shows up in theorems like "Cauchy sequences are convergent", e.g.) Much of our intuition from real analysis is based on this property. Spaces on which sequences converge to points outside the space are very difficult to do analysis on! (Consider trying to do calculus on the rational numbers, for example.)</p>
