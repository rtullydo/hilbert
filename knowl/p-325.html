<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We're arrived at one of the major differences between inner product spaces and normed spaces. While the Riesz representation theorem tells us essentially everything about the continuous linear functionals on a Hilbert space, questions turn out to be significantly more complicated in the realm of Banach space. N. Young points out the following, seemingly easy question - given \(x, y\) distinct elements in a normed space \(E\text{,}\) does there exist a linear functional that “separates points”; that is, can we find a functional \(F\) on \(E\) so that \(F(x) \neq F(y)\text{?}\) In Hilbert space, the answer is immediate: yes, because \(F = \ip{\cdot}{x - y}\) will do the job. In a general normed space, the answer is much more subtle and requires the central theorem of functional analysis, the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahn%E2%80%93Banach_theorem" target="_blank">Hahn-Banach theorem</a>, which is well beyond the scope of these notes and typically introduced in a first course in functional analysis (see e.g. <a class="external" href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387972459" target="_blank">Conway 2007</a>.).</p>
