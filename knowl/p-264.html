<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">It is important that we not overstate the implications of the theorem above. In finite dimensions, for example, the space of polynomials of degree at most \(n\) is isomorphic to \(\C^n\) but is also a set of functions with properties that interact with the geometry of \(\C^n\text{.}\) Both the vector space properties and the functional properties are important - what the isomorphism provides is a set of properties that the space carries by relation with Euclidean space. In the same way, while all separable Hilbert spaces can be thought of as \(\ell^2\) in some sense, it is the interplay between, say, analytic properties and the Hilbert space structure that we are interested. However, it is valuable (and useful) to know that we can think of Hilbert space as \(\C^n\) or \(\ell^2\) when it is convenient.</p>
