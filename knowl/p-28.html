<p>Operators contain more information than the invertibility of the functions that they represent. For the following discussion, let us fix a basis of a vector space \(V\) and let \(A\) be the matrix that represents a function \(T: V \to V\text{.}\) A scalar \(\la\) and a vector \(v\) are said to be an <dfn class="terminology">eigenpair</dfn> for \(A\) if</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A v = \la v.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>It is straightforward to see that the set of all vectors \(v\) for which the eigenvector equation holds is a subspace of \(V\text{,}\) called the <dfn class="terminology">eigenspace</dfn> associated with \(\la\text{.}\) The eigenspaces of the matrix \(A\) are its <dfn class="terminology">invariant subspaces</dfn>, which is to say that a vector in an eigenspace is mapped by \(A\) to the same eigenspace. It turns out that knowing the invariant subspaces of \(A\) are often enough to completely characterize \(A\text{.}\) If \(A\) is \(n\times n\) and \(A\) has \(n\) linearly independent eigenvectors (that is, one can find a basis of \(\F^n\) consisting of eigenvectors of \(A\)), then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A = S D S\inv,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(S\) is a matrix of eigenvectors and \(D\) is a diagonal matrix of the associated eigenvalues (including repetition of course). (One should think of \(S\) as a change of basis matrix under which the operator \(A\) becomes diagonal.)</p>
