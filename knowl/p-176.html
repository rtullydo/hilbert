<p>So how much can two functions differ and still have the same integral? We define a subset \(N\) of \(\R\) to be a <dfn class="terminology">null set</dfn> if for any \(\eps &gt; 0\) there exists a sequence of intervals \((a_n, b_n)\) with \(E \subseteq \cup_n (a_n, b_n)\) and \(\sum_n (b_n - a_n) \lt \eps\) - that is, \(E\) is a null set if it is contained in the union of a set of intervals of arbitrarily small total length. Two functions are said to be equal <dfn class="terminology">almost everywhere</dfn> if they differ only on a null set. In the Lesbesue integral, if \(f\) and \(g\) are equal almost everywhere, then the integral of \(\abs{f - g}^2\) is zero, and so \(f\) and \(g\) must be regarded as equal in \(L^2\text{.}\) This indicates that the elements of \(L^2\) are properly considered as <em class="emphasis">equivalence classes</em> of almost everywhere equal functions. In practice, we still refer to the elements as functions and treat equality as almost everywhere equality. This viewpoint does, however, mean that functions need only be defined almost everywhere to belong to \(L^2\text{.}\) For example, \(f(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{\abs{t}}}\) is in \(L^2[-1,1]\) despite the asymptote at \(t = 0\text{.}\)</p>
