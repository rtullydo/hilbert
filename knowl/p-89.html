<p>Our focus is going to be on the analysis of inner product spaces of functions. But many spaces of functions can be equipped with metrics that do not arise from inner products. We've already seen \(C[a,b]\text{,}\) the space of continuous functions on \([a,b]\text{,}\) which is an inner product space with inner product <a data-knowl="./knowl/eq-C-ip.html" title="Equation 2.1.1">(2.1.1)</a>. Another natural notion of distance in this space is to measure the maximum modulus of the pointwise distace between the functions:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
d_{\sup}(f,g) = \sup_{[a,b]} \abs{f(x) - g(x)}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is the metric that corresponds to <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_convergence" target="_blank">uniform convergence</a> of sequences of functions in \(C[a,b]\) and thus is natural and useful. However, the open sets in this metric do not coincide with the open sets in the inner product topology. In fact, there is no inner product on \(C[a,b]\) that corresponds to the maximum modulus metric.</p>
