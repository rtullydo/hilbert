<p>Let us consider an analogy with linear algebra. The space \(\R^n\) can be acted on by a linear transformation, which can be realized as multiplication by a matrix \(M\) that represents the linear transformation. Such an \(M\) can be any size that is compatible with matix mutiplication. If we choose a transformation that is represented by a vector \(y\) of size \(m \times 1\text{,}\) then we've created a function on \(\R^n\) that takes \(\R^n \to \R\text{.}\) The space of all such functions is itself \(n\)-dimensional (since each function arises from a vector in \(\R^n\)). Multiplication of two vectors that results in a scalar output already has a form that we know - namely, we can write any such function in terms of its representing vector \(y\) by</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y: \R^n \mapsto \R \text{ by } y(v) = \ip{v}{y}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">This is a simple case of a powerful theorem called the Riesz representation theorem. A function on \(\R^n\) of the form \(\ip{\cdot}{y}\) is called a <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">linear functional</dfn>. One of the core ideas of functional analysis is that we can often move phenomena and relationships that exist among the elements of a vector space into <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">dual</dfn> relationships among elements of the space of linear functionals.</p>
