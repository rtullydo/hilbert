        <title>Banach algebra stuff</title>
        <p>Note: developing a discussion of the GNS construction and full spectral theorem.</p>

        <p>Here be the Axiom of Choice.</p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-zorn"><title>Zorn's Lemma</title>
            <p>If every totally ordered subset of a partially ordered set has an upper bound, then the partially ordered set has a maximal element.</p>
        </theorem>

        <definition xml:id="def-banach-algebra">
            <p>A Banach algebra is an algebra <m>\A</m> (for us over <m>\C</m>) with a norm <m>\norm{\cdot}</m> that makes <m>\A</m> a Banach space and 
            <me>
                \norm{ab} \leq \norm{a}\norm{b}
            </me>
            for all <m>a,b \in \A</m>.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>We'll assume that our Banach algebras have unit.</p>

        <p>The idea of a Banach algebra is to make sure that the multiplication structure is compatible with the norm (i.e. the multiplication should be continuous). Banach algebras are a natural sort of idea - thinking of matrices as representing linear transformations, matrix multiplication (on square matrices) represents composition. It turns out that for a Hilbert space <m>\HH</m>, the space <m>\B(\HH)</m> of bounded linear operators on <m>\HH</m> is a Banach algebra with the multiplication operation given by composition of maps.</p>

        <p>As in classical complex analysis, we can define a notion of analytic functions taking values in a Banach space <m>\L</m> - a function <m>f</m> is analytic on a domain <m>D \subset \C</m> if <m>f</m> can be expanded as a power series in a neighborhood of every point <m>\la \in D</m>.</p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-resolvent-analytic">
            <p>Let <m>A \in \L</m>. Then the resolvent set <m>\rho(A)</m> is an open subset of <m>\C</m>. The <term>resolvent</term> map <m>A \mapsto \la I - A</m> is an analytic function of <m>\la</m> on <m>\rho(A)</m>.</p>
        </theorem>

        <proof>
            <p>This is a consequence of the fact that the invertible elements are an open subset of a Banach algebra.</p>
        </proof>

        <title>Spectrum in a Banach algebra</title>

        <p>The following theorem is a generalization of <xref ref="thm-compact-spectrum"/>.</p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-nonempty-spectrum">
            <p>If <m>\A</m> is a Banach algebra over <m>\C</m> with identity, then for any <m>a \in \A</m>, the spectrum <m>\sigma(a)</m> is a non-empty compact subset of <m>\C</m>.</p>
        </theorem>

        <title>Gelfand transforms</title>
        <p>I'm not sure the best way to do this, so I'll start sketching. Expanding on Conway and Lax I think.</p>

        <p>While Banach algebras arise from analytic considerations, there are fruitful connections to be considered by viewing them algebraically (shocking, I know). Best start by looking at some (algebra) homomorphisms and using them to build a parallel structure.</p>



        <definition xml:id="def-division-algebra">
            <p>An algebra <m>\A</m> is a <term>division algebra</term> if every non-zero <m>a \in \A</m> has a multiplicative inverse.</p>
        </definition>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-gelfand-mazur">
            <p>If <m>\A</m> is a Banach algebra that is also a division ring, then <m>A = \C</m> in the sense that <m>\A \equiv \{\la 1: \la \in \C\}</m>.</p>
        </theorem>
