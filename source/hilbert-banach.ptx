        <title>Limits</title>

        <p>With the inner product given by <xref ref="eq-ell2-ip"/>, the space <m>\ell^2</m> of sequences of square summable functions acts much like <m>\C^n</m>. We can extend this analogy further. In Euclidean space, a sequence that looks convergent is convergent. (This shows up in theorems like "Cauchy sequences are convergent", e.g.) Much of our intuition from real analysis is based on this property. Spaces on which sequences converge to points outside the space are very difficult to do analysis on! (Consider trying to do calculus on the rational numbers, for example.)</p>

        <p>On the other hand, recall the space <m>\ell_0</m> <xref ref="def-ell0"/>. In <xref ref="ex-ell0"/>, we constructed a sequence of vectors in <m>\ell_0</m> that converged in <m>\ell^2</m> but not in <m>\ell_0</m>. That is, if we restricted our attention to the inner product space <m>\ell_0</m>, we could not perform any analysis using limits, because we might leave the space.</p>

        <p>As our ultimate interest is in examining function spaces, we can also consider an example in <m>C[0,1]</m>. A natural norm on <m>C[0,1]</m> is induced by the inner product <xref ref="eq-C-ip"/>, so that
            <me>
                \norm{f} = \int_0^1 \abs{f(x)}^2 \, dx.
            </me>
        With respect the norm above, consider the sequence
        <me>
            f_k(x) = \min ((2x)^k, 1).
        </me></p>

                    \begin{axis}[domain=0.0001:1.0, ymax=4, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$, samples=200]
                    \addplot+[no marks]{min(1,(2*x)^2)};
                    \addlegendentry{$f_2$};
                    \addplot+[no marks]{min(1, (2*x)^4)};
                    \addlegendentry{$f_4$};
                    \addplot+[no marks]{min(1, (2*x)^10)};
                    \addlegendentry{$f_{10}$};
                    \addplot+[no marks]{min(1, (2*x)^20)};
                    \addlegendentry{$f_{20}$};
                    \end{axis}
                \end{tikzpicture}

        </image>

        <p>It isn't difficult to show that the elements in this sequence of functions grow arbitrarily close as <m>k \to \infty</m> with respect to <m>\norm{\cdot}</m>. It should also be clear from the figure above that this sequence of continuous functions is approaching a discontinuous function in the limit. (What is it?) That is, <m>C[0,1]</m> is evidently not closed with respect to <m>\norm{\cdot}</m>.</p>

        <p>We would very much like to work in spaces where limits make sense. So we'll introduce some machinery that will guarantee that this is the case.</p>

        <definition xml:id="def-cauchy-seq">
            <p>Let <m>(M, d)</m> be a metric space with distance function <m>d</m>. A sequence <m>(x^k)</m> in <m>M</m> is called a <term>Cauchy sequence</term> if for every <m>\eps > 0</m>, there exists an integer <m>K</m> so that <m>k, l > K</m> implies that <m>d(x^k, x^l) \lt \eps</m>.</p>

            <p>If every Cauchy sequence in <m>M</m> converges to a limit in <m>M</m>, then <m>M</m> is called a <term>complete metric space</term>.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>Some metric spaces come complete. The prototypical space is <m>\R</m>, where the result that Cauchy sequences are convergent is a standard test question in real analysis. (Can you prove it?). Completeness of <m>\R</m> implies completeness of <m>\C</m>. (Do it.) More complicated spaces take more work.  We've already seen examples of spaces that are not complete. </p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-ell2-complete">
            <p>The space <m>\ell^2</m> is a complete metric space with the metric induced by the inner product <xref ref="eq-ell2-ip"/>.</p>
        </theorem>

        <proof>
            <p>We need to show that any Cauchy sequence in <m>\ell^2</m> is convergent to another <m>\ell^2</m> sequence. First, we propose a candidate for the limit of a Cauchy sequence of vectors in <m>\ell^2</m>. To do so, we'll need to take advantage of the fact that vectors in <m>\ell^2</m> are themselves sequences.</p>

            <p>Consider the array we can construct by arranging the vectors <m>x^k</m> as rows -
                <me>
                    \begin{array}{cccccc}
                    x^1 \amp = \amp (x^1_1, \amp x^1_2, \amp x^1_3, \amp \ldots)\\
                    x^2 \amp = \amp (x^2_1, \amp x^2_2, \amp x^2_3, \amp \ldots)\\
                    x^3 \amp = \amp (x^3_1, \amp x^3_2, \amp x^3_3, \amp \ldots)\\
                    \vdots \amp \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \\ \hline
                    (x^k) \amp \amp (x^k_1) \amp (x^k_2) \amp (x^k_3) \amp 
                    \end{array}
                </me>
            </p>

            <p>We are going to argue that the column sequences in the array above are convergent. Consider the <m>j</m>-th column sequence <m>(x^k_j)</m>. Choose <m>\eps > 0.</m> Because <m>x^k</m> is a Cauchy sequence of vectors, there exists some <m>K</m> so that <m>k, l > K</m> implies that <m>\norm{x^k - x^l} \lt \eps</m>. But since <me>\norm{x^k - x^l} = \left(\sum \abs{x_i^k - x_i^l}^2\right)^{1/2} \lt \eps</me> and each term in the sum is positive, we get <m>\abs{x^k_j - x^l_j} \lt \eps</m> when <m>k, l > K</m>. This shows that <m>(x^k_j)</m> is a Cauchy sequence in <m>\C</m>, which is a complete metric space, and so <m>(x^k_j) \to y_j</m> for some limit <m>y_j \in \C</m> as <m>j \to \infty</m>. Let <m>y = (y_j)</m> be the sequence of column limits. This is our candidate limit in <m>\ell^2</m> for the sequence of vectors <m>x^k</m>.</p>

            <p>Let us show that <m>y \in \ell^2</m>. To do so, we will show that <m>x^k - y</m> is in <m>\ell^2</m> for some <m>k</m> and use the vector space structure of <m>\ell^2</m>. Let <m>\eps > 0</m> be given. Since <m>x^k</m> is Cauchy, there exists <m>K</m> so that <m>\norm{x^k - x^l} \lt \eps</m> for all <m>k, l > K</m>. Noting again that the terms are positive, it is clear that for <m>k, l > K</m>, 
            <me>
                \sum_{i=1}^N \abs{x_i^k - x_i^l}^2 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \abs{x_i^k - x_i^l}^2 \leq \eps^2.
            </me>
            We previously showed that the sequences <m>x_i^l</m> converge to <m>y_i</m>, so taking a limit as <m>l \to \infty</m> on the left-hand side of the inequalty gives
            <me>
                \sum_{i=1}^N \abs{x_i^k - y_i}^2 \leq \eps^2.
            </me>
            This statement holds for all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>, and so letting <m>N</m> tend to <m>\infty</m> gives us
            <me>
                \sum_{i=1}^\infty \abs{x_i^k - y_i}^2 \leq \eps^2,
            </me>
            which is to say that <m>\norm{x^k - y} \lt \eps</m>. Having shown that <m>x^k - y</m> is in <m>\ell^2</m>, we note that <m>y = x^k - (x^k - y) \in \ell^2</m>, which concludes this step of the proof.</p>

            <p>The final step is to argue that the sequence <m>x^k \to y</m>. In the previous step, we showed that for a given <m>\eps</m>, there exists <m>K</m> so that <m>k > K</m> implies that <m>\norm{x^k - y} \lt \eps</m>. Thus, <m>x^k</m> converges to the <m>\ell^2</m> sequence <m>y</m>. Since every Cauchy sequence converges to a limit in <m>\ell^2</m>, we conclude that <m>\ell^2</m> is a complete metric space.</p>
        </proof>

        <exercise>
            <p>Show that <m>\ell^\infty</m>, the space of bounded sequences of complex numbers with the supremum norm is complete.</p>
        </exercise>

        <p>We are now (finally) ready to define Hilbert spaces. The distinction between Hilbert spaces and inner product spaces is important to keep in mind.</p>

        <definition xml:id="def-hilbert-space">
            <p>A <term>Hilbert space</term> is an inner product space which is a complete metric space with respect to the metric induced by its inner product.</p>
        </definition>

        <definition xml:id="def-banach-space">
            <p>A <term>Banach space</term> is a normed space which is complete with respect to the metric induced by its norm.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>As inner products induce norms, every Hilbert space is a Banach space. The converse statement is not true. Examples abound of complete normed spaces in which the parallelogram rule fails to hold (and thus there can exist no inner product that induces the norm.) In fact, our results to now show that <m>\ell^\infty</m> is an example of a Banach space that is not a Hilbert space. Banach spaces are an area of wide interest in mathematics, but the lack of an inner product makes the structure much more delicate to parse. The central spaces of functional analysis are Hilbert spaces, where the inner product gives useful geometry not available in the more general setting of Banach spaces.</p>

        <p>We'll continue by looking at perhaps the single most important Hilbert space of functions.</p>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="hilbert-2"><title><m>L^2[a,b]</m></title>
        <p>We saw in the previous section that <m>C[0,1]</m> is an inner product space that is not complete. This is unfortunate, as the continuous functions are the foundation of approximation and analysis. The inner product <xref ref="eq-C-ip"/> is a natural analogue of the inner product in <m>\C^n</m>, considering the extension of sums to integral. It seems a shame to forgo working with the inner product and the space of continuous functions. But if we want to use them, we'll need to come up with a Hilbert space that contains <m>C[0,1]</m>, which is necessarily going to involve discontinuous functions (see the example at the beginning of the previous section, or the exerise in the problem section below).</p>

        <p>The move from <m>\C^n</m> to <m>\ell^2</m> provides an analogy - moving to infinite dimensions requires that we use square-summable sequences to get a well-defined inner product. The same turns out to be true here - sums become integrals, so we will work with the <term>square-integrable functions</term>, which we denote <m>L^2[0,1]</m>. That is, <m>L^2</m> consists of those functions <m>f</m> for which the integral of <m>\abs{f}^2</m> is finite. The sharp-eyed reader may notice that we have not written this in mathematics as <m>\int_0^1 \abs{f}^2 \, \dd t</m> and instead used the weasel-word <q>integrable</q>.</p>

        <p>At issue is how we define the integral. The Riemann integral is the familiar <m>\int f \, \dd x</m> that we learn in elementary calculus. Many more functions <m>f</m> on <m>[0,1]</m> will satisfy 
        <me>
            \int_0^1 \abs{f}^2 \dd t \lt \infty,
        </me>
        than <m>C[0,1]</m>, and yet even this space is incomplete. We need a better integral. The <term><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integration">Lesbesgue integral</url></term> is significantly more challenging to develop than the Riemann integral, and we will not attempt that in this course. It is enough for us to accept that a more powerful notion of integration exists so that the space of square-integrable functions is complete with respect to <xref ref="eq-C-ip"/>.</p>

        <example xml:id="ex-L2"><title><m>L^2(a,b)</m></title>
            <p>Let <m>-\infty\leq a \lt b \leq \infty</m>. <m>L^2(a,b)</m> is the space of Lesbesgue measureable functions <m>f:(a,b)\to \C</m> which are square-integrable - that is,
            <me>
                \int_a^b \abs{f}^2 \, \dd t \infty,
            </me>
            with pointwise operations and inner product <xref ref="eq-C-ip"/>.</p>
        </example>

        <p>The condition that <m>f</m> be Lesbesgue measurable is not terribly restrictive. One can study and use the theory of <m>L^2</m> functions in a wide variety of physical and mathematical applications without ever needing to grapple with the oddities of non-measureable functions, which are quite difficult to construct. To get an idea of how bad a function can be and still be Lesbesgue integrable, consider the function
        <me>
            s(t) = \left\{
                    \begin{array}{ll}
                    1 \amp \text{ if } t \in [0,1]-\mathbb{Q} \\
                    0 \amp \text{ if } t \in [0,1]\cap \mathbb{Q}
                    \end{array}
                    \right.
        </me> 
        which integrates to 1 in the Lesbesgue integral, while the Riemann integral runs screaming in horror.</p>

        <p>There is one issue that needs to be addressed when defining membership in a space with an integral condition - when should we consider two functions to be equal? If we take the function <m>f(t) = t</m> and move one point, say <m>g(t) = t</m> when <m>t \neq \frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>g(t) = 0</m> when  <m>t = \frac{1}{2}</m>, the functions behave identically under the integral and thus in the inner product and the metric in <m>L^2</m>. More precisely, if two functions differ only at a finite set of points in <m>(a,b)</m>, then 
        <me>
            \norm{f - g}^2 = \int_a^b \abs{f - g}^2 \, \dd t = 0
        </me> 
        and so by <xref ref="def-norm"/> (1), <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> must be equal in <m>L^2</m>.</p>

        <p>So how much can two functions differ and still have the same integral? We define a subset <m>N</m> of <m>\R</m> to be a <term>null set</term> if for any <m>\eps > 0</m> there exists a sequence of intervals <m>(a_n, b_n)</m> with <m>E \subseteq \cup_n (a_n, b_n)</m> and <m>\sum_n (b_n - a_n) \lt \eps</m> - that is, <m>E</m> is a null set if it is contained in the union of a set of intervals of arbitrarily small total length. Two functions are said to be equal <term>almost everywhere</term> if they differ only on a null set. In the Lesbesue integral, if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are equal almost everywhere, then the integral of <m>\abs{f - g}^2</m> is zero, and so <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> must be regarded as equal in <m>L^2</m>. This indicates that the elements of <m>L^2</m> are properly considered as <em>equivalence classes</em> of almost everywhere equal functions. In practice, we still refer to the elements as functions and treat equality as almost everywhere equality. This viewpoint does, however, mean that functions need only be defined almost everywhere to belong to <m>L^2</m>. For example, <m>f(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{\abs{t}}}</m> is in <m>L^2[-1,1]</m> despite the asymptote at <m>t = 0</m>.</p>

        <p>One of the more useful properties of <m>L^2[a,b]</m> is that the continuous functions <m>C[a,b]</m> are a <term>dense</term> subspace (that is, every <m>L^2</m> function can be approximated by a sequence of continuous functions). A typical approach in analysis is to show that some property hold on the continuous functions and then extend the result to <m>L^2</m> by approximation.</p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-L2-closed">
            <p><m>L^2[a,b]</m> is a Hilbert space.</p>
        </theorem>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-cont-dense">
            <p><m>C[a,b]</m> is a dense subspace of <m>L^2[a,b]</m>.</p>
        </theorem>

        <p>The theorem above is a consequence of measure theory, which requires the development of the Lebesgue integral to justify. We must accept the result, for the moment, on faith. The interested reader should look at Lusin's theorem and the Tietze Extension Theorem for a taste of a standard method of proof in the general case.</p>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="hilbert-3"><title>The closest point property</title>
        <p>One of the most useful ideas in linear algebra is projecting onto subspaces - if <m>v \in \R^n</m> and <m>U \subseteq \R^n</m> is a subspace, then <m>\proj_U v</m> is the closest point in <m>U</m> to <m>v</m> in the sense that the orthogonal distance from <m>v</m> to <m>U</m> is minimized (this is also called least squares approximation).</p>

        <p>The same idea holds true in Hilbert space and applies to vectors that are functions. This fact has deep consequences - that functions can be understood through the geometry of vectors is the soul of modern approaches to functional analysis. </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-convex">
            <p>A subset <m>A</m> of a real or complex vector space is <term>convex</term> if, for all <m>a, b \in A</m> and all <m>0 \lt t \lt 1</m>, the point <m>ta + (1-t)b \in A</m>.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>We should think of convex sets <m>A</m> as those that contain the line segments <m>\{ta + (1-t)b: t \in [0,1]\}</m> between all points <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>A</m>.</p>

        <p>First, we show that the closest point property holds - that a given vector <m>v \in V</m> has a unique closest point in any appropriately <q>flat</q> set <m>A</m> in <m>V</m> (like a linear subspace).</p>
        
        <theorem xml:id="thm-closest-point"><title>Closest point property</title>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be a non-empty closed convex set in a Hilbert space <m>\hilbert</m>. For any <m>x \in \hilbert</m>, there is a unique point of <m>A</m> which is closer to <m>x</m> than any other point in <m>A</m>. That is, there is a unique point <m>y \in A</m> such that
            <me>
                \norm{x - y} = \inf_{a \in A} \norm{x - a}.
            </me></p>
        </theorem>

        <proof>
            <p>The proof will consist of two parts. First, we show that the infimum of distance between <m>x</m> and <m>A</m> is attained. (We should recall that the infimum itself exists is a consequence of the completeness of the real numbers, e.g.<url href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/m125b/ch2.pdf">Theorem 2.6</url>.) Second, we show that this point is unique in <m>A</m>.</p>

            <p>Let 
                <me>M = \inf_{a\in A} \norm{x-a}.</me>
            We assumed that <m>A</m> was not empty, and so <m>m</m> must be some finite number. Since the infimum is a limit point, we can construct a sequence <m>\norm{x - y_n}</m> tending to <m>\norm{x - a}</m>. That is, for each integer <m>n</m>, there exists some <m>y_n</m> so that 
                <me>
                    \norm{x - y_n}^2 \lt M^2 + \frac{1}{n}.
                </me>
            We now move from a sequence in norm to a sequence in <m>A</m> by showing that <m>y_n</m> is Cauchy in <m>A</m> - that is, we need to show that <m>\norm{y_n - y_m}</m> is small. We first apply <xref ref="thm-parallelogram"/> to the sequences <m>x - y_n</m> and <m>x - y_m</m>. For any <m>m,n \in \mathbb{N}</m>, we have 
            <md>
                <mrow>\amp\norm{(x - y_n) - (x - y_m)}^2 + \norm{(x - y_n)+(x - y_m)}^2</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp= 2 \norm{x - y_n}^2 + 2\norm{x - y_m}^2</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp\lt 4M^2 + 2\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{m}\right).</mrow>
            </md>
            The term we are trying to bound is <m>\norm{(x - y_n) - (x - y_m)} = \norm{y_n - y_m}</m>. On rearrangement, we get
            <md>
               <mrow> \norm{y_n - y_m}^2 \amp\lt 4M^2 + 2\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n}\right) - \norm{2x - y_n - y_m}^2</mrow>
               <mrow>\amp= 4M^2 + 2\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n}\right) - 4\norm{x - \frac{y_n - y_m}{2}}^2</mrow>
           </md>
            Now we will use the convexity of <m>A</m>. Since <m>y_n, y_m \in A</m>, we know that <m>\frac{1}{2} y_n + \frac{1}{2} y_m =\frac{y_n + y_m}{2} \in A</m>, and hence that 
            <me>
                M^2 = \inf_{a \in A} \norm{x - a}^2 \leq \norm{x - \frac{y_n + y_n}{2}}^2.
            </me>
            Consequently,
            <md>
                <mrow>\norm{y_n - y_m}^2 \amp\leq 4M^2 + 2\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{m} - 4M^2\right)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = 2\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{m}\right).</mrow>
            </md>
            It follows that <m>(y_n)</m> is a Cauchy sequence in <m>A</m>; for a given <m>\eps > 0</m> (you should verify). Because <m>\hilbert</m> is a Hilbert space, Cauchy sequences converge, and so <m>y_n \to y \in \hilbert</m>. Since <m>A</m> is closed, <m>y \in A</m>. On the one hand, this means that <m>\norm{x - y} \geq M</m>, since <m>M</m> is an infimum. On the other hand, we know that for all <m>n</m>, 
            <me>
                \norm{x - y_n}^2 \leq M^2 + \frac{1}{n}.
            </me> On taking <m>n \to \infty</m>, we get <m>\norm{x - y} \leq M^2</m>. We conclude that <m>\norm{x - y} = M</m>, and so <m>y</m> is a closest point in <m>A</m> to <m>x</m>.</p>

            <p>Now we show that <m>y</m> is the <em>unique</em> closest point. Suppose that there is some <m>w \in A</m> with <m>\norm{x - w} = M</m>. Convexity gives that <m>\frac{y + w}{2} \in A</m>, and so
            <me>
                \norm{x - \frac{y + w}{2}} \geq M.
            </me>
            Applying <xref ref="thm-parallelogram"/> to <m>x-w</m> and <m>x - y</m> gives
            <md>
                <mrow>\norm{y-w}^2 \amp= 2\norm{x-w}^2 + 2\norm{x-y}^2 - 4\norm{x - \frac{y + w}{2}}^2</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \leq 2M^2 + 2M^2 - 4M^2 = 0.</mrow>
            </md>
            Thus, <m>y=w</m> which gives uniqueness.</p>
